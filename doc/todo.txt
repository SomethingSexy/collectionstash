Approval compare, rework for associated model changing - ie, collectibletype_id

Pagination->search from a tag/collectibletype is broken



the confirm page for contribute doesn't have all the same information as review

Need to make sure all views are consistent -> scale



Think about adding an approval table back in -> go in later

Registry -> just make simple for now

Exclusive - retailer? How about Exlcuisve by? Comic Con, Celebration IV -> Go in later

Collectible Approve Edit -> This is done for collectible, need to add for upload


When add image fails, it looks goofy

make sure that tags are not added with commas

Tag editing needs to happen

There is a weird thing going on with ' and amp encoding for textbox

ampersand encoding and url too



Create a list of names you cannot register



attributes -> clothing -> cloak
attributes -> clothing -> boots




Think about making attribute description not required

Image upload error message size not coming through

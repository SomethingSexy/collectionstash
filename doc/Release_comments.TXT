Each collectible will have topics, if there is only one topic, then it will be auto expanded,
Otherwise each discussion topic will be collapsed with maybe a title, summary and the last thing posted in it

I will not allow adding topics to start so that the system works the only way

Need to figure out the best way to link Collectibles and Stashes to topics, I am think topic groups, maybe add a type field so that can look up in that table where it belongs

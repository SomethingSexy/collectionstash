We want to support:

user customs - customs from user created parts

bashes - custom from other parts

original pieces


All three of these share the same attribute of being an original 1/1 piece.


Original piece would get added to an artist as a 1/1...do we need a special field for that?
Have a way to indicate that when adding...force it to be 1/1...ask the user if they want it added
to their stash right away...otherwise we need a claiming proces later?

If they don't own it maybe it goes through the approval process?

If someone goes throught the standard way to add a collectible and they set it to 1/1 warn them or give them an error message

Work flow changes:
- Submit New Collectible
  -> Add Collectible
    -> Original or Mass Produced
       - Do we need a new page for this? Or do we have help text or tooltips that indicate how to add an original ?
       - Do originals go through the approval process? If an original is being added, should I ask them if it is theirs? If so, it is automatically
         added and does not need to go through the approval process? 
  -> Add Custom
    -> Bash or scratch
       - These are automatically added to the user's stash, can only be updated and edited by them at anytime
       - These do not go through the approval process.
    -> receipe
        - FUTURE USE



Customs
  - Each custom will be added as a new collectible, this is so we can use everything but if it is a custom it can only be edited by the user who added it
    and it can only be added to that person's stash.  That user should automatically be added as the artist as well.    
  - new table customs?
    - id, bash_collectible_id, custom_status_id 
    - Custom Status - Draft / WIP / Complete
    - Create a custom to use as a receipe? Wouldn't be a legit custom but something you could put together for recommendations? 
      - 
  - collectible table updates
    - custom_id (this would be added to the collectible because each collectible would only have one custom row if it is a custom) 
    - custom (boolean) - added just for ease of use I think
  - Hide fields:
    - product code
    - product UPC
    - all collectible details section
    - URL should not be required
  - rename fields
    - release year = year made 
    - price = cost    
  - permissions
    - user creating the custom is the only person who can update it...besides admin - changes go live
    - what about parts? If the user added a new part and it is attached directly to the collectible, maybe they are the only ones with permission to update it, besides amdin? should be live

Subscriptions Table

This will contain a user_id and what they are subscribing too

We will want to use the cake 2.1 event system

Everytime we do an update or a comment add, we will trigger a subscription check event

That will then take what they subscribed to, look up what to do in the notifications table and then send off that notification


Will we need some sort of subscriptions type table? Similar to the comment_type table?


SELECT *
FROM subscriptions
JOIN entity_types ON ( subscriptions.entity_type_id = entity_types.id )
WHERE entity_types.type = 'stash'

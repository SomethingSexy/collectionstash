Nice to haves:
- Remember me checkbox
- drag and drop stash adding
- added filtering to the stash view, like the catalog
- If it is a variant, make the "Yes" a link to the parent collectible.
- Admin page to clean up any venue/exclusive retailers and then if I am going to combine them have a way for the page to combine retailers into one
- Add a widget on every page, if you are logged in that shows you the number of collectibles in your stash and maybe total cost

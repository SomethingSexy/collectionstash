Prior to release:
- Need to enable extension=php_soap.dll and extension=php_openssl.dll in php.ini, need to make sure it is enabled for apache php and standard server


New Table:
- Transactions 
  - id, 
    user_id (person who added it)
    collectible_id, 
    transaction_type_id (eBay, amazon, internal), 
    ext_transaction_id (item id for lookup), 
    type (auction, bin, direct), 
    listing_price (initial bid/buy it now) 
    sale_price, (amount of the transaction), 
    number_of_bids, 
    status (active, completed), 
    
    start_date, 
    end_date (same if internal), 
    processed (have we internally processed), 
    created, 
    modified, 
    


If the user marks a collectible as sold and they did it on eBay they will then be asked to link the item number.  If they do we will add it as an eBay transaction, otherwise, an internal one

Version 2.5.2
- Remove dialog
- History


Collectibles_User table updates

- collectible_user_remove_reason_id  - putt his here for quick access, if there is a listing we will also return that 
- listing_id - we can use this past sales and the marketplace, listing_type_id will = 2 for generic external - Store/BIN or trade  when we have marketplace we will have a listing_type_id = 3 which will be internal trade or store/bin
- active,inactive -> is this table necessary? Maybe just a boolean to determine if active 
- remove_date - fast reference



New Table
- CollectibleUserRemoveReasons     - this table will also have some information on whether we force a delete or not
  - sold
  - traded


If the remove reason is sold then we prompt to ask how much it sold for and we create an appropriate listing/transaction
If the remove reason is traded then we prompt to ask what it was traded for and we create an appropriate listing/transaction

Prior to release:
- Need to enable extension=php_soap.dll and extension=php_openssl.dll in php.ini, need to make sure it is enabled for apache php and standard server


New Table:
- Transactions 
  - id, 
    user_id (person who added it)
    collectible_id, 
    transaction_type_id (eBay, amazon, internal), 
    ext_transaction_id (item id for lookup), 
    type (auction, bin, direct), 
    listing_price (initial bid/buy it now) 
    sale_price, (amount of the transaction), 
    number_of_bids, 
    status (active, completed), 
    
    start_date, 
    end_date (same if internal), 
    processed (have we internally processed), 
    created, 
    modified, 
    


If the user marks a collectible as sold and they did it on eBay they will then be asked to link the item number.  If they do we will add it as an eBay transaction, otherwise, an internal one

Nice to haves:
- Remember me checkbox
- drag and drop stash adding
- added filtering to the stash view, like the catalog
- tile view for catalog - same one I am using for stash - make auto scroll as well

TODO:
- download fancy box plugin and use that on stash tile view to enlarge images
- auto scroll, infinite-scroll.com, stash tile view
- Update Stash Photos page
- update Stash Comments
- Enlarge the image on both the user collectible page and the collectible page as the default
- add fancy box to both pages above
- Notifiy a user if they already have a collectible when addnig to stash, display this when they are on the add page a list at the top that shows the current collectibles of this type they have
- If it is a variant, make the "Yes" a link to the parent collectible.

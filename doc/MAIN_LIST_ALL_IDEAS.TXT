Update to Collectible Edit
    One page collectible add
    
    
    Have all of the fields blank and they edit everything on a single page
    
    This will make it easier for me to maintain in the future
    
    The only thing they need to select first would be the type of collectible it is,then when I do this I can add in new collectible types.
    
    This will create a new collectible that will be in draft status, new attributes and uploads will be done the same way.
    
    They can then come back to edit their drafts until they are ready to submit. Other users should be able to view the drafts and can post comments on them
    
    Allow multiple collaborations on a collectible so other people can work on them....nice to have
    
    Real time checking to see if one exists? Or maybe it does it before you submit for approval?
